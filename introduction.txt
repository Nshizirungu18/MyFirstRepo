Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is nshizirungu and I’m a passionate creative entrepreneur from Rwanda. I enjoy blending art and technology to design practical solutions that empower communities and celebrate African identity. I’m currently diving into tools like Git and GitHub to enhance my digital skills and collaborate on impactful projects.

I value transparency, creativity, and learning through iteration. I believe version control will help me organize my ideas more effectively and work better with others. I’m excited to build solutions that are not only functional but deeply meaningful.
